    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This Vietnamese-style noodle salad is my 'too hot to cook' staple. It is
      bursting with flavor and makes great use of leftover grilled meat or
      shrimp.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
      <li>¼ cup water, or more to taste</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons lime juice</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons brown sugar, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon Sriracha chile sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol class="directions">
      <li>
        Whisk water, lime juice, fish sauce, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, and
        Sriracha together in a bowl until the sugar is dissolved.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of water to a full boil; remove from heat and soak
        rice noodles in the hot water for 1 minute. Stir to separate the noodles
        and continue soaking until the noodles are tender, about 3 minutes more.
        Drain noodles and rinse with cold water until cooled. Shake noodles in
        colander to drain as much water as possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix noodles, cabbage, carrots, shrimp, bean sprouts, cucumber slices,
        green onions, mint, cilantro, and basil together in a large bowl.
        Drizzle the dressing over the salad and toss to coat. Top with chopped
        peanuts.
      </li>
    </ol>
